ROS 2 (robotics middleware built on DDS for message passing and more) is purpose-built for the communication problem — coordinating messages between robots, drivers, and software components across network boundaries. It is sometimes applied to the computation problem — parallelizing work inside a single system or process.
In prototyping, this approach can accelerate development. In more mature deployments, however, it can produce architectures where too many processing steps exist as separate nodes.</description></item><item><title>Research progress</title><link>https://jamesakl.com/posts/research-progress/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jamesakl.com/posts/research-progress/</guid><description>Often, when researchers disagree about what topics or approaches to prioritize, they are also disagreeing on what kinds of progress are more important. This stems from implicit preferences in research goals and aesthetics. One researcher might dismiss a theoretical model as impractical, while another sees a prototype as ephemeral.
These tensions reflect deeper contrasts in how progress is interpreted and pursued. ‘Progress’ can&amp;rsquo;t be decomposed cleanly, but it can still be probed through contrastive axes.</description></item><item><title>Premature intervention</title><link>https://jamesakl.com/posts/premature-intervention/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jamesakl.com/posts/premature-intervention/</guid><description>In systems and software, premature intervention can be harmful. The term “premature optimization” represents a broader concern than is often understood. Usually, this involves making critical changes or wasting efforts before system parameters are understood (requirements, constraints, trade-offs, …) thereby adding complexity and reducing adaptability.
Instances of premature intervention include: (but are not limited to)
Premature abstraction (≈ introducing abstractions before behavior stabilizes, obscuring intent and increasing indirection) Premature modularization (≈ imposing module boundaries before cohesion and coupling are evident, which can restrict flexibility) Premature implementation (≈ committing to code before key programming decisions are settled, resulting in rework) Premature architecting (≈ applying patterns or frameworks before goals and constraints are clear, adding rigidity) Premature scaling (≈ designing for performance, scale, or concurrency beyond foreseeable need, wasting effort) Premature optimization (≈ optimizing code without profiling or identifying bottlenecks, which can reduce clarity) Premature generalization (≈ engineering for speculative use cases that are imagined without basis, increasing complexity without payoff) Premature tooling (≈ building automation or infrastructure before workflows stabilize, risking misalignment) Intervention is good and timely when grounded by strong reasons.</description></item></channel></rss>
