ROS 2 (robotics middleware built on DDS for message passing and more) is purpose-built for the communication problem — coordinating messages between robots, drivers, and software components across network boundaries. It is sometimes applied to the computation problem — parallelizing work inside a single system or process.
In prototyping, this approach can accelerate development. In more mature deployments, however, it can produce architectures where too many processing steps exist as separate nodes.</description></item></channel></rss>
